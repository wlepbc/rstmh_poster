### Introduction

Leprosy is an infectious disease with a long, variable incubation period. It is primarily caused by the bacterium _Mycobacteriium leprae_. Leprosy is curable through the use of multi-drug therapy (MDT).

Outside of the Americas there is little published evidence of transmission from non-human reservoirs of infection. Taking this as evidence that non-human reservoirs are not an important source of transmission, then the removal of infection from people by treatment should reduce the incidence of infection.

Early diagnosis and use of MDT are the principle tools used to combat leprosy. There is no diagnostic test for sub-clinical cases. The social stigma associated with leprosy remains a barrier to early diagnosis.

In 1991, the World Health Assembly resolved to eliminate leprosy as a pubic health problem by the year 2000. This target was defined in practice as a prevalance of less than 1 registered case per 10,000 of the global population. Progress was helped by the provision of free MDT through the World Health Organisation, initially by the Nippon Foundation and since 2000 by the Novartis Foundation. The global target was achieved, but leprosy remains an important public health problem at a national and regional level for a number of countries.

The WHO Roadmap and London Declaration set a new target for leprosy control. This is a reduction in the number of new cases with grade 2 disability to below one per million of the global population by 2020. There is evidence that the degree of leprosy-related impairment is linked to the delay between onset of clinical symptoms and diagnosis.

Appropriate assessment and setting of goals requires information about the current situation and possible future outcomes. We use back-calculation to provide both:
* estimates of the underlying  incidence of undiagnosed clinical and sub-clinical cases, and
* short-term forecasts of future outcomes.

The back-calculation is applied in a Bayesian context, giving probabalistic outcomes which are reflective of the possible variability in outcomes.

### Aims

The project is intended to provide analyses to support the achievement of the WHO Roadmap goals, and the management of leprosy control programmes in general.

This poster is intended to introduce the study and it's potential to the RSTMH audience.
