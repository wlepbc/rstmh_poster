### Summary

#### Current levels of underlying sub-clinical and clinical infection.

The 'current' levels were estimated for 2014 - the last year with observed data and hence the last year for which forecasting was not necessary.

The levels of sub-clinical and undiagnosed clinical cases extant in 2014 are such that even if transmission were broken in 2014, those cases would still be seen over a number of years (it is inherent in our analysis that we are dealing with those cases which result in eventual diagnosis). Using this incubation period and detection delay distribution the diagnosis years of these cases can be forecast.

#### Forecasting of the probability of NCDR being less than 1 per 10,000

The probability of the annual new case detection rate being less than 1 per 10,000 of the state population was used as an example of a goal which might be set. Note that it is a state level version of the World Health Assembly's global target for 2000. Many states in Brazil have little or no chance of achieving that goal, at a state level, by 2020.

#### State level results

The results for Espirito Santo illustrate how well the model fits to the observed data. In addition certain parameters are estimated which may provide some insight into the leprosy control programme. The case detection success/speed parameters indicate that there case detection has been more successful post-2000, but that there has not been a signicant increase in the second half of that period.

There are considerable differences in the results for different states.

### Addressing the Roadmap goals

We have demonstrated the utility of our approach for making inferences about the underlying levels of leprosy and short-term forecasting. For the rest of our project we will focus directly on addressing the WHO Roadmap Goals, adapting the back-calculation to include grade 2 disability and analysing national-level data sets to give an overview of the global goals.
